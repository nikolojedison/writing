# git & GitHub
Normally, I make a repository on GitHub, then clone it using `git clone` onto my laptop or desktop to do editing. I'll explain my workflow in a separate paragraph down below, so don't worry if it seems foreign in this opening bit.

## git
`git` is a *version control system* that comes installed on most Linux systems (I don't recall whether it's installed on Ubuntu or not, but can be installed with `sudo apt-get install git`), and written by the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds.
`git` uses a system of *repositories* to keep track of your data and changes made to it. Each change made is kept in a *commit*, and commits can hold multiple changes to the same file or to multiple files - normally, though, commits are used to keep track of changes that may break a program/system or make something act in a nonsensical manner. `git` also uses a system of *releases* and *branches* to keep track of larger changes to programs or files if you should choose to do so, but for the purposes of someone who's using `git` for mainly writing, I don't use it often - when using `git` for programming, the likelihood of using branches and releases more often goes up.
* `git add [filename]` - *stages* the file named for the next commit - basically, takes all the changes made to the selected file since the last commit, and tells `git` to list the changes when the commit is made. Normally, I do a bunch of work, and use `git add -A` to automatically add any changed files to the commit.
* `git commit -m "[commit message]"` - makes the actual commit, with the title/message as listed after `-m`. This is normally enough to keep track of major changes, and I often do it before *pushing* my changes to GitHub (explained further down).

## GitHub
GitHub is a website ([github.com](https://github.com)) used for hosting `git` repositories. Normally, after creating an account, you can make, edit, and delete your own publicly visible repositories. If you sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), you will then be able to make private repositories (invisible to everyone bar the people you give access), as well as get some other programming & development-related free stuff. 
After making a remote repository (normally just referred to as a repository) on GitHub, you'll probably want to edit it on your laptop or desktop - and you can do that by *cloning the repository*. After the repository's cloned, you can move files to the remote repository by *pushing to the repository* or *pushing to the remote*, and you can get any changes from the repository by *pulling from the repository* or *pulling from the remote*. 
**PLEASE NOTE** that neither `git` nor GitHub will move any files to or from GitHub or another hosting site without you explicity doing something - you will always have to push your changes to and from the remote repository in order to have the changes synced across devices. This is initally a pain, but you get used to it relatively quickly, and once you adapt the way you work to pushing and pulling, it starts to feel like second nature.
* `git clone [url]` - clone a remote repository into a new folder within your current directory, inside a folder named after the repository (for example, if you cloned the remote that this repository is from, then you would have a new folder - `writing` - in the directory you cloned the repository into). 
Think of it as downloading the repository as a folder, without having to unzip any of it, and without having to set up a git repository all over again.
* `git push origin master` - push all commits that currently are not on the remote to the default GitHub branch and server. This is normally what you want to do after making a bunch of commits and/or you make a really important change - I normally do it after I finish a chunk of work, and one last time before I pack up to switch locations or head home. 
If you were pushing from the current repository into a different remote branch within the same repository (for example, if you were using the GitHub Development Model or whatever they call it now that uses a mess of branches to keep track of what code is which), you would use `git push origin [branch name]`, where [branch name] is the name of the branch that you want to push to. Note that this will overwrite the contents of the remote branch with whatever you committed locally. 
* `git pull origin master` - pull all commits from the default remote server branch that have occurred since you last pushed to the `master` branch. If you edit any files on GitHub instead of your computer, you should probably run this before editing files on your computer to avoid *conflicting commits*, which are weird and sometimes hard to resolve events that occur when there are different versions of a file or files stored on your local laptop or desktop and the remote server.
Like `git push`, you can change the branch you're pulling from by using `git pull origin [branch name], where again, [branch name] is the branch that you want to pull from. Again, note that by pulling from a remote branch, you'll be taking any commits from that branch and putting it on the branch you're currently in (by default, the master branch).
